# Machine Learning For Space Exploration
In this project, sklearn is implemented to create models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## About the dataset:
The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle, containing 10000 exoplanet candidates examined by the Kepler Space Observatory. More information about the dataset can be obtained from the link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results).
